Strengths and achievements: What were your core contributions this year? What was the impact of your accomplishments?

This year, my primary focus was on delivering MLOps PoC, Central Word Embedding, AI Innovation, and PoC support.  

MLOps PoC: This year, I've successfully delivered  MLOps PoC involving three vendor products Iguazio, Cnvrg.io and AzureML. Though Azure ML was not part of the initial consideration, I included it to access MLOps alignment with strategic MS Cloud. I've taken total ownership and delivered on the 
PoC from creating PoC evaluation criteria
Worked with ChainIq for compliant vendor sourcing   
Engagement with R&D for onboarding and installation
Working with the WG teams to help/implement their solution
Conduct education sessions on MLOps sessions 
Capture learning and summarise PoC results and findings 
There were many challenges, especially the loss of the PoC environment and my medical absence. But to the best of my abilities and available options, I've worked towards completing the PoC assessment.
Beyond the PoC, I've provided an assessment on buy vs build and opensource options and their challenges. I've also contributed to the ADA data science workbench discussions. 
Impact: I've delivered a holistic MLOps framework and identified the final ranking lineup for vendors based on vendors. The recommendations I've provided, when implemented, will contribute towards net improvement and the realisation of investments in homegrown AI/ML models across the group. 

Word Embedding: I've delivered the first version of the PoloBERT model in Q1 2021 for John Priest and his ARI team and worked closely to ensure that the offered model was aligned towards the team's unarticulated needs. The delivered model was implemented in production after it was verified that it outperformed the incumbent. I also ideated and delivered the PoloBERT QA module to showcase the benefits of this brand of language models. Though I've handed over responsibilities of this model to my colleague, continue with architectural and technical support. I've also laid the foundation for other models like CioBERT.I've continued to help in coming up with the documentation and education material for the PoloBERT. 
Impact: A language model for UBS delivered and centrally made available through Agora for groupwide consumption. This model is expensive to build from a cost, talent and lack of data. When used on internal use-cases, this model has the potential to outperform vanilla BERT models.

Global AI innovation advisory and PoC Support

PoC Support: I've taken ownership of end-to-end aspects of delivering the IB COO contract intelligence PoC with Cortical.io. This involved :
Device PoC success criteria and  agreement on the same with IB COO  
Worked with ChainIq for compliant vendor sourcing and product onboarding with R&D
Lead weekly discussions with vendor and IB COO to track progress and challenges 
Documented learnings and PoC results
  
Innovation support:
Few instances of supporting teams with different consultation sessions:
GCTO Data Architecture: I advised the group on different aspects of  taking their model to production, articulated pitfalls in their approach and recommended ways to create reproducible models
Collaboration during these discussions leads to creating a Knowledge Graph and ML working group between AICoE and GCTO Data Architecture. 
Advised multiple teams, including IB Tech Advisory, IB IT, Treasury IT, with their challenges in taking models to production 
Aided in candidate identification and interviewing for ToC data science team lead role
 Advised ToC team on with plans for specialist search engine for assist

Model Testing Framework
This was identified as a stretch exercise to be started in Q4. So far, we've had internal discussions to understand the existing state of things on tools and practices. Due to an overflow of items in Aug/Sep due to my covid related absence, I could not make much progress.

Apart from the above, I've onboard two GTPs from the previous into the team this year. I self-initiated opened roles, onboarded 3 UK GTPs and 2 CH GTPs for various roles.  I've worked with them closely to shape their individual goals and objectives. I've planned, prepared and executed for this. 

Development areas: 
This year was again a year of transition for the team, so It became difficult for me to position my work, not as a competition but complementary to existing efforts, especially MLOps. But I hope to continue challenging the status quo and fill knowledge and experience gaps where possible and when available. I prefer to get the mandate for delivery on relevant items for the ADA Data Science workbench more than just consulting.  

I've worked on the feedback from last year on improving PowerPoint and presentation skills. I hope this is reflected in the various MLOps presentations I've done this year. 


I've leveraged my more comprehensive network of connections both in immediate teams like IT R&D, ISE platforms team, GCTO engineering team and extended network within aligned CTO teams to deliver my work.
I've also collaborated within business teams, which WM CIO has recognised.    

I've acted with high integrity with all aspects of my interactions with startups/vendors, always working on getting the best cost advantage for UBS.  I always clarified my approach in that respect.

I've challenged behaviour both within the team and elsewhere to work towards the team and organisational objectives. I've also encouraged this within my unit.
