 the key contribution this year was towards, among others 

Word embedding: the research, experimentation, data acquisition, model building, creation of the demo app and documentation for Polo BERT. PoloBERT is the first of its kind model in UBS, which encompass UBS specific language. He also spent significant time building a Question and Answer model for the demo. The impact of delivering this model is that other teams can use it instead of making it from scratch, especially for NLP use-cases involving UBS data. He actively participated in multiple presentations.

Knowledge Graph: Supporting the SMU project with deep dives in creating data models and supporting documentation. Though this topic and tool were new to Zicong, he was able to pick up the required skills and help Helen throughout the process. 

-  Azure ML POC Zicong was able to work independently right from the start. This turned out to be a challenging task as internal documentation were of no real help. With some guidance, he was able to do the exploration on his own. He took the opportunity to engage and interact with folks from MS and took control of his delivery end-to-end. With a bit of nudge, he was able to keep the pressure on MS to respond to our queries and follow-ups.

Though Azure ML exploration had to be conducted twice (Internal and external), he worked through it with no hesitation. 
-----------------------
Zicong has, through his GTP rotation, picked up a good level of understanding of NLP techniques. Beyond the immediate and valuable skills developed through working on BERT, to broaden his horizon with classical NLP and machine learning techniques. Continuous learning will help him to gain holistic experience in DS/ML. 

Zicong was involved in the documentation and presentation this year. He has taken feedback and effectively improved his documentation. He should realise that documentation is also part of the deliverable. He has utilised his opportunities to present and get better.

 Zicong needs to be more proactive in challenging perspectives and not hesitate in doing so. 
--------------------------

Zicong acts with high integrity at all times and takes responsibility for his actions at all times. He collaborates effectively with folks relevant to projects and always makes he delivers on time. He can make his engagements better by following up with teams he works to maintain active feedback loops. 

Beyond work-related engagements, I encourage Zicong to leverage his role in AI CoE to contribute to UBS's broader AI/ML ecosystem. In whichever way, he is comfortable.

The key contributions from Jackson this year was on :

MLOps PoC:  Jackson made a valuable contribution towards the Iguazio and Cnvrg PoCs. Through this process, he has gained practical understanding and experience with the whole MLOps life cycle. He actively participated in various discussions with vendors. He gained trust to be left alone to carry out discissions independently. He played an active role in raising issues as and when we identified it. 

Wordembedding: Jackson developed the PoloBERT QA demo app, which helped present the usefulness of the model. The tech stack used to make it work in UBS Azure proved difficult, but Jackson persisted and preserved to get it done.  He also took the suggestion to get the app available in Agora and got it done. 

Azure SPOC for AI CoE: 
Jackson has taken responsibility for all aspects of Azure for AI CoE. This included infra setup, configuration, ongoing support etc. His involvement helped in consolidating efforts across the team. His colleagues recognise his efforts and contribution in the area. For instance, making containers work in K8s has proven difficult due to a lack of documentation. But Jackson has collaborated with multiple teams to get it done. The same can be said about his efforts in making cognitive speech services work.






-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jackson has worked on improving his presence in discussions. He should speak up more to get his points across effectively. On this front, he has undoubtedly performed better with external engagements; I'd like to see more of this in internal discussions as well. 

Jackson needs to communicate more effectively when he faces challenges during the course of a task. This will help others to know the challenges better and appreciate his contribution even more. Between status updates, Jackson needs to communicate progress effectively.  

While focusing a lot on ML Engineering tasks, Jackson should also focus more on gaining an appreciation for DS and specifically modelling. This, in turn, will help him in building scalable systems.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jackson has utilised the opportunity and established himself as a trusted  SME for all things Azure. He has taken total ownership of Azure architecture and subscriptions. Jackson has been highly approachable. There were instances where he offered support even during the holidays and weekends to support their deliverable. 

Jackson acts with high level of integrity in all of his business and remedies the situation when issues arise. His work on monitoring costs for Azure is appreciated.

Jackson, by virtue of working in AI CoE ends up unearthing issues (in the Azure ecosystem, cognitive services etc.) At his level, he can do more in challenging the staus quo (be it CBO/ISE/GCTO) to push for progress.

Beyond work-related engagements, I encourage Jackson to leverage his role in AI CoE to contribute to UBS's broader AI/ML and Azure ecosystem. In whichever way, he is comfortable.
